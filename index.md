# What is Error Permissive Computing?

We ([AIST](https://www.aist.go.jp/)) are exploring a new concept of _Error
Permissive Computing_ that improve the capability and capacity while drastically
reducing power consumption. More specifically, we controllably allow hardware
errors and develop system software to assure acceptable computational results.
For example, an error correction technique can result in increased latency and
reduced capacity. By taking a holistic approach across the layers from hardware
to software, lightweight and appropriate error correction is performed at the
software layer while eliminating general purpose error correction in hardware
layer.
